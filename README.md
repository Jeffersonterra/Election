#System will will count votes for yes or no and close when vote 0 is registered and write in txt the results
- System will ask to keep or flush previous results, input 1 to keep input 2 to flush
- Any other number will not compute and system will ask again for a number between 1 and 2
- System will print -vote 1 for yes - vote 2 for no -vote 0 to close system 
- Input the vote desired
- System will loop back and close when vote 0 is registered
- System will print the total votes for yes and no
- If the operation tipe is not in between 1 and 2 will not register vote and print "vote not registered"
- System will now generate a txt file named result with the result of the election with all the yes and no votes
- If required to flush system will now flush all previus results from txt file
- Enjoy!
